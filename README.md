ELNET1 Group Project: ASP.NET Web Application
Welcome to the ELNET1 Group project! ðŸŽ‰ We're building a dynamic and responsive web application using ASP.NET Core, aiming to deliver a powerful, secure, and user-friendly experience. Our focus is on creating an application that not only performs smoothly but also integrates seamlessly with databases and offers a secure login system.

This project showcases our skills in web development with features like user authentication, database management, and a responsive UI designed to adapt to any device. We're excited to dive into the world of ASP.NET and bring our ideas to life in a real-world application.

We're still deciding on a final project name, but weâ€™re eager to get started and share our journey with you!
